# hide-streaming-controls
Pretty basic chrome extension to hide the streaming controls on various platforms, not necessarily the most complex project in the world but I figured it would be worth putting it on here in case anyone found it useful.

## Installation
To install, simply download the files, go to google chrome, go to the manage extensions page, hit load unpacked, and load from the src folder and you're done.

## Usage
Simply click the extension and it'll work, you can toggle it on and off.
